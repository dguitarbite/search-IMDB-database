Well Im making this repository for people like me who are lazy want a huge database or a medium database from IMDB database.

you will need to have installed imdb packages 
::
   #apt-get install imdb-tools

well this should work with nearly all debian systems. 

After this you will have to install python if you are not on Linux based systems(You suck cuz you dont have linux so im not going to help you with this).

How to use.... 

Well its a work in progress and the code will be better explained and modified to give better outputs and functionality.
So please bear with the low quality stuff.

Well the program will ask you for the range for which you want to add the database and will only add those programs which
have complete database.
I am really lazy so ive created a small parsing snippet myselves , just to avoid the monotonus parsing work.... :D
::
   i = i[i.find('_')+1:]
   i = i[0:i.find('_')]

If you guys want to contact me , just shoot an email to me @  `pps.pranav@gmail.com`
and you are free to shoot abuse, arrows, bullets what every your countries law allows you to ... 
but suggestions are more than welcome.

Thank you for going through this worthless piece of shit which i amuse myselves as useful to create movie databases...
